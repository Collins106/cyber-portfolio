description: This portfolio showcases a series of practical cybersecurity projects focused on risk assessment, vulnerability management, access control, and data protection. Each project reflects real-world security challengesâ€”from investigating insider incidents and enforcing least privilege to evaluating exposed database servers and classifying network assets. Guided by NIST SP 800-30, SP 800-53, and SP 800-61 frameworks, I conducted qualitative risk analyses, identified threat sources, and proposed actionable mitigation strategies that align with business and compliance objectives. Collectively, these projects demonstrate my ability to think critically, apply structured methodologies, and implement security controls that strengthen organizational resilience across both cloud and on-premises environments.
