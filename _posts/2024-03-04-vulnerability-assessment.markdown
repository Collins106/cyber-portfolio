description: This portfolio showcases a series of practical cybersecurity projects focused on risk assessment, vulnerability management, access control, and data protection. Each project reflects real-world security challenges‚Äîfrom investigating insider incidents and enforcing least privilege to evaluating exposed database servers and classifying network assets. Guided by NIST SP 800-30, SP 800-53, and SP 800-61 frameworks, I conducted qualitative risk analyses, identified threat sources, and proposed actionable mitigation strategies that align with business and compliance objectives.

üß† Access Control Incident Investigation and Mitigation**

Description:
Conducted a detailed investigation into a financial anomaly within a small business network, reviewing event logs to identify suspicious access and weaknesses in identity governance. Applied access control principles and NIST SP 800-53 (AC-2, AC-3) to trace shared credentials, inactive account exposure, and missing offboarding controls. Recommended strong mitigations including Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), multi-factor authentication (MFA), automated access revocation, and SIEM-based anomaly detection. Strengthened understanding of identity lifecycle management, log analysis, and cybersecurity risk governance.

üîê Data Risk Assessment and Least Privilege Implementation Review

Description:
Performed a data privacy incident review focusing on enforcement of the principle of least privilege. Investigated a leak resulting from excessive data sharing within an ed-tech company. Evaluated existing access controls and mapped weaknesses to NIST SP 800-53 AC-6. Recommended automated access reviews, time-limited permissions, and revocation processes to minimize exposure. Demonstrated understanding of privacy controls, human error mitigation, and organizational compliance through technical and policy recommendations.

üè† Home Office Asset Classification and Sensitivity Assessment

Description:
Developed a comprehensive inventory of home office network devices to evaluate cybersecurity posture in a small business setup. Classified assets based on their confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact. Applied a structured sensitivity model (Public ‚Üí Private ‚Üí Confidential ‚Üí Highly Confidential) to identify high-risk assets such as laptops and backup drives. Proposed network segmentation, encryption, MFA, and regular firmware updates. Reinforced asset visibility, data protection, and risk-based prioritization skills aligned with ISO 27001 and NIST frameworks.


 üåê Public-Facing Database Vulnerability Assessment

Description:
Performed a NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1-aligned vulnerability assessment of an e-commerce company‚Äôs cloud database server that had been exposed to the public internet. Identified and rated critical threats such as SQL injection, insider misuse, and denial-of-service attacks. Created a risk matrix (likelihood √ó severity) and developed remediation plans including network isolation, Zero Trust access, encryption, and SIEM monitoring. Delivered executive-level reporting with qualitative analysis, actionable roadmap, and defense-in-depth security strategy.


üßæ Vulnerability Assessment and Risk Mitigation Report

Description:
Conducted a full vulnerability and risk assessment for a remote e-commerce database environment using NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 methodology. Evaluated open exposure, assessed risk levels, and documented threat events across confidentiality, integrity, and availability domains. Proposed a multi-layer remediation strategy incorporating least privilege, MFA, firewalls, and encryption controls. Enhanced proficiency in translating complex technical risk findings into executive summaries for decision-makers and compliance audits.
