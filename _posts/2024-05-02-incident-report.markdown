üß© Cybersecurity Projects Overview

These projects represent my journey as a cybersecurity analyst ‚Äî applying everything I‚Äôve learned about network security, incident response, and system hardening.
Each one gave me hands-on experience in analyzing real-world attacks, capturing live traffic with tools like **Wireshark** and **tcpdump**, and documenting security incidents using frameworks like **NIST CSF**.
Together, they show how I approach a problem: **analyze, respond, secure, and prevent.**

üîê Brute Force Attack and Website Compromise

This project was about investigating how a former employee carried out a brute force attack on a company website.
They guessed the admin‚Äôs default password and added malicious JavaScript that redirected visitors to a fake site with malware.
I analyzed the **network traffic**, identified the **DNS and HTTP behavior**, and documented the attack chain.
To prevent future incidents, I recommended **two-factor authentication (2FA)**, stronger password policies, and a **web application firewall (WAF)**.
It taught me how dangerous weak credentials can be ‚Äî and how to document, fix, and secure web infrastructures properly.

üíª SYN Flood Denial of Service (DoS) Attack

Here I analyzed a **SYN Flood** attack that took down a company‚Äôs website by overwhelming it with TCP handshake requests.
Using **packet analysis**, I was able to explain exactly how the attack worked and what caused the system to crash.
My solution included enabling **SYN cookies**, **rate limiting**, and deploying an **IDS/IPS system** to detect suspicious traffic before it becomes a problem.
This project helped me understand how important it is to balance detection and prevention when dealing with denial-of-service attacks.

üåê Network Protocol Analysis ‚Äì DNS Port Unreachable

This one was more on the troubleshooting side. The company website kept returning a ‚Äúdestination port unreachable‚Äù error, so I used **tcpdump** to trace the issue.
I discovered that the problem was with **UDP port 53**, meaning DNS traffic was being blocked at the firewall.
After digging into the packets, I proposed firewall rule changes and tested DNS resolution again to confirm the fix.
It reinforced how understanding network protocols ‚Äî especially **UDP, ICMP, and DNS** ‚Äî is key to finding and fixing connection issues quickly.

üß± Network Hardening Risk Assessment

This project focused on assessing a **data breach** at a social media company that exposed user information.
After reviewing their setup, I found the biggest issues were password sharing, a default admin password, and lack of firewall rules or MFA.
I built a **risk assessment plan** and suggested network hardening strategies ‚Äî things like **firewall rule enforcement**, **strong password policies**, and **multifactor authentication**.
This one showed me how much difference small, consistent security habits can make in preventing future breaches.

üõ°Ô∏è NIST CSF Incident Report ‚Äì DDoS Attack

In this one, I applied the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** to analyze a **DDoS attack** on a multimedia company‚Äôs internal network.
The attack used ICMP floods that took systems offline for two hours.
I documented how the attack happened, mapped it across the NIST CSF functions (**Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover**), and recommended improvements like **firewall ICMP rate-limiting**, **IP verification**, and **IDS/IPS deployment**.
This project helped me build a structured approach to incident response ‚Äî not just reacting, but creating a clear, repeatable plan.

üìÑFinal Report ‚Äì Web Application Data Breach

This report covered an e-commerce data breach that exposed customer records because of a **forced browsing vulnerability**.
I analyzed the cause, assessed the impact, and recommended fixes like **URL allowlisting**, stronger access control, and regular **penetration testing**.
It helped me practice forensic thinking ‚Äî connecting how a small misconfiguration can lead to a major data exposure.

üß† What These Projects Show**

All together, these projects highlight my ability to:

* Analyze and interpret **network traffic** using **Wireshark** and **tcpdump**
* Document and respond to incidents using frameworks like **NIST CSF**
* Identify vulnerabilities and recommend **real-world mitigation steps**
* Communicate technical findings clearly through professional security reports
