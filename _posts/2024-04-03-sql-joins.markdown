description: This project demonstrates practical skills in both SQL and Linux system administration. Using a Linux environment, I created and managed a database, executed SQL queries to analyze datasets, and automated routine tasks through command-line operations. The project highlights my ability to navigate the Linux terminal efficiently, manage files and permissions, and apply SQL for data retrieval, filtering, and reporting. Together, these skills reflect a strong foundation in database management and operating system fundamentalsâ€”essential capabilities for cybersecurity and IT operations.
