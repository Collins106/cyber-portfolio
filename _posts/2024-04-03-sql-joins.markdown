description: This project demonstrates practical skills in both SQL and Linux system administration. Using a Linux environment, I created and managed a database, executed SQL queries to analyze datasets, and automated routine tasks through command-line operations. The project highlights my ability to navigate the Linux terminal efficiently, manage files and permissions, and apply SQL for data retrieval, filtering, and reporting. Together, these skills reflect a strong foundation in database management and operating system fundamentalsâ€”essential capabilities for cybersecurity and IT operations.

 ðŸ§© 1. Apply Filters to SQL Queries

In this project, I used SQL to filter and investigate authentication logs and employee datasets to identify failed login attempts, suspicious activity, and department-specific information.
I practiced writing queries using **AND**, OR, NOT, LIKE, IN, and date/time filters to isolate patterns in login behavior and employee records.
I retrieved after-hours login failures, filtered geographic data, and performed targeted searches for specific departments like Marketing, Finance, and Sales.
This project taught me how SQL logic can directly support security investigations â€” from tracking access anomalies to managing endpoint inventory â€” using structured data analysis.

ðŸ§­ 2. Linux Directory Navigation and File Exploration for Security Operations

This lab was focused on mastering Linux command-line operations for system and log exploration â€” a critical part of SOC workflows.
I worked with commands like `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, and `head` to navigate directories, inspect log files, and retrieve important system data.
By exploring files such as user reports and server logs, I learned how to quickly locate evidence, identify warnings, and verify user or system information.
This exercise strengthened my confidence in Linux environments and built a foundation for **log analysis, incident response, and file system investigations â€” core skills for any cybersecurity analyst.

ðŸ§± 3. Linux Package Management and Network Analysis Tool Installation

This project gave me hands-on experience managing and configuring security tools on a **Debian-based Linux system** using **APT (Advanced Package Tool)**.
I installed and verified applications like Suricata (for network intrusion detection) and Tcpdump(for packet capture and analysis), practicing installation, removal, and validation commands through the terminal.
By setting up and managing these tools, I gained practical insight into how security applications are maintained in production environments.
This lab helped me understand network monitoring, **dependency management, and how to maintain tool reliability in SOC operations.

ðŸ§  What These Labs Demonstrate

Together, these projects show my ability to:

* Write and optimize **SQL queries** for data-driven investigations
* Navigate and analyze Linux file systems during incident triage
* Install, configure, and verify network analysis tools for threat detection
* Combine command-line precision with investigative thinking to support SOC-level operations

They built the core of my technical fluency â€” bridging data analysis, system administration, and network defense â€” skills that I now apply in my more advanced cybersecurity projects.
