description: Performed an in-depth malware investigation using VirusTotal to analyze a suspicious file obtained through a phishing campaign. Leveraged the Pyramid of Pain to classify and understand adversary indicators, including hashes, domains, and TTPs. Correlated findings with the MITRE ATT&CK framework to identify threat actor behaviors and escalation patterns. Documented the entire analysis workflowâ€”covering hash evaluation, static inspection, and contextual threat intelligence enrichment. Delivered detailed remediation recommendations and detection strategies to strengthen malware defense and threat intelligence capabilities.
