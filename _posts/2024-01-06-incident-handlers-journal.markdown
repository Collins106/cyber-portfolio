Description: Conducted a malware investigation using VirusTotal and the Pyramid of Pain framework. Analyzed a phishing-related malicious file to identify indicators of compromise (IoCs), mapped adversary TTPs to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and documented pain points affecting adversarial operations. Delivered recommendations to enhance malware detection and threat intelligence sharing.

description: Conducted a risk assessment for Botium Toys' IT environment, identifying vulnerabilities in asset management, encryption, access control, and disaster recovery planning. Applied the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to evaluate compliance readiness, assigned a risk score, and proposed actionable mitigation strategies to enhance organizational resilience.


project-url: {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdfs/Final%20report.pdf

description: Authored a comprehensive incident response report analyzing a real-world web application vulnerability that resulted in data exposure. Outlined the full response lifecycle, including identification, containment, eradication, and recovery. Summarized investigation findings, provided root cause analysis, and presented actionable remediation steps aligned with NIST SP 800-61 and ISO/IEC 27035 standards.


project-url: {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdfs/Incident%20handler's%20journal%20.pdf

description: Provided clear and concise written documentation of a real-world cybersecurity incident response process. Detailed each event chronologically using an Incident Handler’s Journal format, including the initial detection, containment actions, eradication steps, and recovery outcomes. Documented the tools and techniques used—such as SIEM monitoring, malware analysis, and communication logs—to support investigation accuracy. Reflected on lessons learned, process improvements, and the importance of collaboration and documentation in maintaining strong organizational security posture.


project-url: {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdfs/Tcpdump%20Network%20capture%20packet%20data.pdf

description: Captured and analyzed live network traffic using tcpdump to identify HTTP, DNS, and ICMP packets. Applied BPF filters to isolate suspicious traffic, examined packet headers, and interpreted communication flows for network forensics. Strengthened command-line network analysis proficiency essential for SOC monitoring and incident response.


project-url: {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdfs/Use%20a%20playbook%20to%20respond%20to%20a%20phishing%20incident.pdf

description: Executed a structured phishing response playbook simulating a Tier-1 SOC analyst investigation. Verified malicious email attachments through VirusTotal, extracted IoCs, performed escalation assessment, and documented findings in an incident ticket. Demonstrated practical understanding of SOC triage and escalation workflows aligned with best practices.


project-url: {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdfs/Vulnerability%20assessment%20report.pdf

description: Conducted a comprehensive vulnerability assessment of a publicly exposed database server using the NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 framework. Identified risks from external actors and misconfigurations, evaluated threat likelihood and impact, and recommended remediation strategies—including access controls, MFA, and encryption—to strengthen data protection.


project-url: {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdfs/Wireshark_Network_Traffic_Analysis_Lab_Overview%20(1).pdf

description: Performed detailed packet analysis using Wireshark to investigate ICMP, DNS, HTTP, and TCP protocols. Applied capture filters, inspected frame headers, and correlated protocol activity to real network events. Delivered insights into network anomalies and enhanced visibility for intrusion detection and response.
